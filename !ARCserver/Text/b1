{bfg y} The ARCbbs software provides a versatile BBS base with definable menus,
multiline support, multitasking, and comprehensive messaging and file areas.
 Being multitasking means that your machine is not tied up when the BBS is
being run: you can run other RISC OS tasks (memory permitting) whilst the
BBS is loaded and running. FidoNet EchoMail and MatrixMail is supported.
