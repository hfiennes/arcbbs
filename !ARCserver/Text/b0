{bfg y}This BBS is being run on ARCbbs software, written by the Sysop. The hardware
used is an A440/1 with Acorn internal 50Mb hard disk and Oak SCSI interface
connected to a OMTI RLL controller which is driving a 71Mb Micropolis drive
(giving 100Mb storage), and a MegaFile 5000 660Mb drive (only 512Mb of
this drive can be used otherwise FileCore falls over!).
 The modems being used are: Hayes V-series QuadPlus V42 on 679794 and
Courier HST Dual Standards on the 670030 lines.
 The A440/1 is fitted with a 30Mhz ARM3 so that the BBS can retain resonable
performance when I am programming in the background (recompiling BBS
versions, etc).

{fg c}The Sysop is Hugo Fiennes (ALT_Man), whose address is:
