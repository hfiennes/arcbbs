#LABEL cont
Would you be willing to pay a charge of 3p per minute (and a local call)
to access Cryton from anywhere in the country at up to 2400 baud with
MNP 5? Note: At all times, this works out cheaper than a 'b' or 'b1' rate
call, and only just more expensive than an 'a' rate call, and existing
0749 numbers would have no time charges.
 Yes
 No

Would you prefer to have the system detailed above or to have lines in
London only with a 1p per minute time charge?
 Whole country at 3p/minute
 London only at 1p/minute
 London with no time charge but with an increased subscription rate
 No

Would you be willing to pay a small subscription to this BBS when we have
external mail, Usenet read/write access and lots of other bits?
 Yes (minimum charge of 3 pounds/month, ie 300 mins/month free at 3p/min)
 Yes (flat charge of 7 pounds per month with free access to london lines)
 No, but I might pay less
 No, I don't want to pay at all

Thanks for answering the questionnaire!
