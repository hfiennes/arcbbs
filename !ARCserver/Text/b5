{bfgbg yn}+ Uploading of messages now possible. BBS works out wether uploaded file
  is ARCed or not (if it IS arced it will dearc the FIRST file in the
  archive and take this as input to the handler).

  Uploaded files consist of records looking like this (terminated by EOF):

  <type> data

  For example to vote 'yes' on message 621, you would use:

  <vote> #621 Y

  To send private mail to Hugo Fiennes:

  <mail> ->Hugo Fiennes
  subject
  text (terminated by end of file or by a new message)

  To send public mail in area 5, as a reply to message 630 (ARCbbs will
  pick up who the message is to from the original message):

  <msg> @5 #630
  subject
  text (terminated by end of file or by a new message)
  
  Public mail in area 5 to All (not a reply to anything):

  <msg> @5 ->All
  subject
  text (terminated by end of file or by a new message)
  
Please mail me if you have any problems with this feature.
