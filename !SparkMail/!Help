Concept:

  !SparkMail provides a simple ARCmail packer in conjunction with !SparkFS.
  Outbound packet(s) are added to archives with PC-style packet names for
  sending the ARCmail to other systems.

  A file attach is automatically generated with the same hold status (ie
  xxxxyyyyHO will be generated if xxxxyyyyHT was the packet arc'ed).

Use:

  !SparkMail MUST be used within the desktop environment. !SparkFS must be
  loaded. Normal use will be from obey files, which call it like this:

  !SparkMail <our address> <outbound address> [compression type]

  for example, to produce ARCmail for Noah (2:252/106.0) from Cryton
  (2:252/102.0) with PC format crunching, I use:

  !SparkMail 2:252/102.0 2:252/106.0 arc

  If no compression type is set then the default 'arc' is used. Other
  compression types supported are 'zip' (PKZIP format), 'compress'
  (SparkFS compress - number of bits set with SparkFS setup) and 'tar'
  (normal tarfile). Alternatively, you can specify the numeric compression
  method to be passed to SparkFS with the SparkFScreate command.

  Return codes are set accoring to what has been done:

  SparkMail$Return  = 0       Normal termination, data was added to arc
  SparkMail$Return  = 1       Normal termination, no data to add to arc
  SparkMail$Return  = 2       Error in command line

  The file attach files have a '^' as the first character on the line,
  indicating that the file should be deleted when sent sucessfully
  by Binkleyterm.

Updates:

  1.00  1-Nov-1990 First version
  1.01  1-Nov-1990 Resets Spark to archie style Archives after arcing mail,
                   also checks DES and garble are off.
                   Checks end of Archive for PC arc terminator (0 as
                   opposed to 128) just in case - some versions of Spark
                   did this sometimes.
  1.02  1-Nov-1990 Outbound mail (xxxxyyyyOT) had a file attach of
                   xxxxyyyyOO generated (oops!). It now generates
                   xxxxyyyyFO.
  1.03  5-Nov-1990 Spark barfs at something occasionally (maybe the -I on
                   its own to reset to Archie archives, this has been
                   changed to -v -I <arcname> to get it to do something,
                   otherwise sometimes there is a problem with inbound
                   mail getting trashed before import! Not sure if this
                   fixes it, the problem has only occurred once here,
                   and I wasn't there to see it!
  1.04  6-Nov-1990 Oops! major problem with 1.03... it didn't generate
                   packets at all <blush> ... well it did, and they
                   were called '-i'...
  1.05 30-Jan-1991 File attach file tweaked: instead of generating a new
                   file, SparkMail appends the filename to the end of
                   an existing file attach file, but only if the ARC
                   didn't exist beforehand (ie if the ARC already existed,
                   SparkMail assumes that it was in the file attach
                   file).
  1.06 21-Oct-1991 Now forces crunch format (with -v) to ensure PC
                   compatiblity whatever Spark is currently set to.
                   If file is already listed in the File-attach file
                   it isn't added again.
  1.07 30-Nov-1991 You can now pass flags to Spark. Will wait for Spark
                   if it's busy.
  1.08 09-Jan-1992 More tweaks to try to ensure spark is in correct
                   archiving mode.
  1.09 19-Nov-1992 4d point support added.
  1.10 01-Dec-1992 4d point support now works :-)
  1.11 08-Dec-1992 4d Arcmail packets now have 8 digits M1 as opposed to
                   4 digits M1 as otherwise bink doesn't recognise it as
                   arcmail, and also it won't get recognised as arcmail
                   at the other end either.
  1.12 16-Dec-1992 Converted to work with SparkFS.
